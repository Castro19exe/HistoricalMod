 innovation_roman_legacy:0 "Imperatoria Exercitus Romanus"
 innovation_roman_legacy_desc:0 "A direct continuation of the army of the eastern section of the Roman Empire, shaping and developing itself on the legacy of the late Hellenistic armies, it maintained a similar level of discipline, strategic prowess and organization. Started with the same basic organization as the late Roman army and its West Roman counterpart, but between the 5th and 7th centuries, the cavalry became more important, the field armies took on more tasks, and the border armies were transformed into local militias. It was among the most effective armies of western Eurasia for much of the Middle Ages."
 ####Themata
 innovation_themata_system:0 "Themata System"
 innovation_themata_system_desc:0 "Themata were established in the mid-7th century in the aftermath of the Slavic invasion of the Balkans and Muslim conquests of parts of Byzantine territory, and replaced the earlier provincial system established by Diocletian and Constantine the Great. In their origin, the first themes were created from the areas of encampment of the field armies of the East Roman army, and their names corresponded to the military units that had existed in those areas. The system was successful in creating a decentralised military structure that could respond quickly to threats and was more effective than the previous centralized system. Themata System was instrumental in preserving the Byzantine Empire during its difficult times and was a key factor in its longevity."

 innovation_varangian_guard_desc:0 "The Varangian Guard was an elite group of warriors who served as the personal bodyguards of the Byzantine Emperors from the 10th to the 14th century. These warriors were initially made up of Scandinavians and Rus, but later included Anglo-Saxons, Slavs, and other Europeans. They were highly respected for their martial prowess, discipline, and fierce loyalty to the Emperor. They participated in many military campaigns and played a critical role in defending the Byzantine Empire and Constantinople from attacks by foreign invaders, including the Bulgars, Rus, and Normans. Over time, the Varangian Guard became more integrated into Byzantine society and culture, and some members even rose to high positions of power and influence."

 ####Pronoia
 innovation_pronoia_system:0 "Pronoia System"
 innovation_pronoia_system_desc:0 "Pronoia was a system of land distribution and taxation in the Byzantine Empire. It was originally designed as a way of rewarding military leaders for their service to the state, by granting them a portion of the revenue generated by certain lands. Pronoiars, or recipients of land grants, were responsible for raising taxes and providing military service in exchange for their land. The system was implemented in the 11th century by Alexius I Komnenos in an attempted to reform the aristocracy and was primarily used to recruit soldiers for the army. Over time, the system became an important part of the empire's economy, and was used to distribute land and tax revenue to a wider group of people. This allowed the state to have a steady source of revenue, while also ensuring that the land was being used productively. While the Pronoia System helped support the Byzantine army, it also led to corruption and abuse. Wealthy individuals were able to use their influence to secure Pronoia grants, while poorer individuals were often left out. Despite its flaws, the Byzantine Pronoia System was an important part of the Byzantine Empire's military and economic structure."

Kataphraktoi best them by using an extra layer of padding to prevent the blunt trauma that will occur, leading to possibly the most armored horsmen of that period. The lamellar klibanion they wore also covered the upper half of the cavalrymens arms with lamellar and shoulder plates combining together, and on top of that the quilted cloth armor, the epilorikion to blunt the power of mace like weapons. A mail or scale gorget would be used to protect the neck. Forearms and lower legs would be protected by lamellar pieces interlocking with each other. Not many of the Stratiotai or Kavallarioi would be able to withstand such a weight and fight with the mace at the same time. They enter the fight after shooting off their javelins but they dont charge to break through as they arent a chargers. They attack and stay there, smashing the enemy with their vardoukion/apelatikion/siderorabdion heavy mace. Those who oppose them would have to slash through 5 layers of armor and padding to hurt them.

Furious in battle and dreadful for tavern owners who were in the way of free drink afterwards, Pelekyphoroi or Native Varrangoi willingly became subjects of the Empire, if anything, had a more standardized and slightly better quality of armor. The thickest “bambakion” cotton gambeson available would be available to them, with scale or mail “lorikion” of the highest quality, and a reinforced “klibanion” lamellar corcelet. The only Imperial troops that can compare to them armorwise are Kataphraktoi and those have a horse under them to carry all that armor, along with themselves.

Since the time of Justinian and the Roman reconquista of Italy, many European warriors offered their military service to the Byzantine Empire. These included Franks, Goths and Lombards. However the most well-known Latinikon were the Norman knights that entered the Empire's service after the first Romano/Norman war in Italy. These Norman knights brought to the Byzantine army the concept of the shock cavalry charge, a tactic foreign to the Empire's forces up until this time. Many times found to be untrustworthy especially when the Empire fought against Catholic states, but they were one of the most reliable against Muslim enemies. In Byzantine service, they often adopted armour and weapon styles from the Roman armoury.#!"

 #Kavallarioi flavor: Kavallarioi was the greek word for “knights” and it meant absolutely the same thing as their western counterparts. Bravery in battle and loyalty would be rewarded with a fief and a title which besides honor would also place them in at least two lists of precedence, but very near the bottom. They would be given a “pronoia” land, but not as large as that of the “Pronoiarioi”.

 ### !!!!Late Medieval Era!!!!
 #Gasmuli Crossbow #Core
 #Gasmuli flavor: In the latter life of the Empire, Latin merchants often made their homes within the Byzantine cities they did business in, often taking Greek women as their brides. Their children were known as Gasmuli. Gasmuli had the reputation of being very skilled sailors and fearsome marines. They often took part in the city's defence as militia, often using crossbows and the swords as their weaponry.
 #Spatharioi tou Vasileos HI #Limit 5 #Emperor only #Guard
 #Spatharioi tou Vasileos flavor: The personal guard of the Emperor. After Excubitors lost their duty as Imperial guards and became one of the four Imperial elite units known as the Vasilica Tagmata, the personal guard of the Emperor was a small, mostly traditional unit called the Spatharioi. Their leading officer was known as Protospatharios tou vasileos and he carried the Emperor's sword in official presentations and ceremonies. The Spartharii had the Imperial armoury at their disposal, and hence they were one of the most heavily armoured units in the medieval world.

 # Game Concepts

 game_concept_varrangoi_desc:0 "The Varrangoi or Vangarian Guard are superb two-handed axemen, protected by heavy armour. The most famous of all Byzantine units, made up wholly of Scandinavians, Rus and Englishmen.\n\nThe Varrangoi were initially a military help sent to the Byzantine Emperor from the 'Rus', which are now a permanent unit often used as Imperial Bodyguards.\n\nThese superbly skilled warriors wield two-handed axes with vicious abandon, hacking down the Emperor's enemies. They are a great menace both to foes and to ordinary Constantinople citizens."
 game_concept_pelekyphoroi:0 "Pelekyphoroi"
 game_concept_pelekyphoroi_desc:0 "As it happened, some of the mercenary Varrangoi of the Empire went native. Those had children with Roman women, who in turn joined in the family business of cracking skulls open with a two handed waraxe.\n\nFurious in battle and dreadful for tavern owners who were in the way of free drink afterwards, Pelekyphoroi or Native Varrangoi willingly became subjects of the Empire, if anything, had a more standardized and slightly better quality of armor. The thickest “bambakion” cotton gambeson available would be available to them, with scale or mail “lorikion” of the highest quality, and a reinforced “klibanion” lamellar corcelet.\n\nThe only Imperial troops that can compare to them armorwise are Kataphraktoi and those have a horse under them to carry all that armor, along with themselves. So it is easy to assume that the Pelekyphoroi must have been at an excellent physical form to be able to not only carry all that armor around, but also fight wearing it."
 game_concept_imperial_army:0 "Imperial Army"
 game_concept_imperial_army_desc:0 "The Imperial Army was composed of professional soldiers and was known for its sophisticated tactics and weapons.One key advantage of the Byzantine Army was its use of heavily-armored cavalry, which provided an effective shock force on the battlefield. The Army also made extensive use of archers and siege weapons, such as the torsion-powered ballista.\n\nAnother hallmark of the Imperial Army was its strict discipline and organization, with soldiers divided into specific units and ranks. The Army was also supported by an extensive network of supply lines and logistics, which allowed them to effectively maintain their forces in the field.\n\nDespite occasional defeats and setbacks, the Byzantine Army remained a powerful force throughout the empire's history, playing a key role in defending the empire against external threats and internal rebellion."
 game_concept_provincial_army:0 "Provincial Army"
 game_concept_provincial_army_desc:0 "The Byzantine Provincial Army was an essential component of the Byzantine Empire's military structure. This army was responsible for the defense of the empire's various provinces.\n\nThe Provincial Army was often composed of locally recruited soldiers who were familiar with the terrain and the particular challenges of each region. This army played a crucial role in defending the empire against invasion from external enemies.\n\nMany successful generals and military leaders in the Byzantine Empire began their careers in the Provincial Army before advancing to higher ranks.\n\nDespite its importance, the Provincial Army was often underfunded and lacked the resources necessary to effectively defend the empire's borders."
 game_concept_border_army:0 "Border Troops"
 game_concept_border_army_desc:0 "The Byzantine Border Troops was an essential element of the empire's defense strategy. Comprised of soldiers from various backgrounds, including Greeks, Armenians, and Slavs, they were a highly trained and well-equipped force.\n\nBorder Troops of Byzantine [provincial_army|E] were able to successfully defended the empire's borders from invaders for centuries, thanks to their strategic positioning and their commitment to protecting their borders.\n\nAlthough they ultimately proved unable to withstand the many invasions that threatened the Byzantine Empire"
 game_concept_degraded_army:0 "Degraded Imperial Army"
 game_concept_degraded_army_desc:0 "Without access to the Imperial war machine, and without access to a centralized Imperial government that could transfer and distribute much-needed resources, local rulers were unable to recruit highly trained and equipped troops.\n\nThey are only limited to the troops they can master with the little resources they have."
